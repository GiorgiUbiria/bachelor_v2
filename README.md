## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **Zustand** for state management
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Zod** for validation

### Backend
- **Go** with **Fiber v3** framework
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **GORM** for ORM
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcrypt** for password hashing

### ML Service
- **Python** with **FastAPI**
- **scikit-learn** for ML algorithms
- **pandas** for data processing
- **numpy** for numerical computations

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Nginx** for frontend serving
- **Docker Compose** for orchestration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bachelor_v2
   ```

2. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080
   - ML Service: http://localhost:8000
   - Database: localhost:5432

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### 1. User Registration & Login
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign Up" to create a new account
3. Fill in the registration form
4. Login with your credentials

### 2. Product Management (Admin Panel)
1. After logging in, click "Admin" in the navigation
2. View the ML Service Dashboard showing recommendation status
3. Click "Add New Product" to add products
4. Fill in product details and submit

### 3. ML Recommendations
1. Go to "Products" page
2. Browse products (recommendations will appear for logged-in users)
3. Products with AI recommendations will have a purple border and "🤖 AI Recommended" badge
4. Search and filter products by category

### 4. ML Service Features
- View ML model status in the admin dashboard
- Train recommendation models using the "Train Models" button
- See real-time status of different ML components

## 📊 Database Schema

The application uses a comprehensive database schema with tables for:
- **Users** and authentication
- **Products** and categories
- **User interactions** for ML training
- **Recommendations** generated by ML models
- **Search analytics** and user behavior tracking

## 🤖 Machine Learning Features

### Recommendation System
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to find patterns in user-item interactions
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends products based on product features and descriptions using TF-IDF
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both methods for better recommendations
- **Cold Start Handling**: Provides fallback recommendations for new users

### Model Training
- Automatic data preprocessing from user interactions
- Real-time model status monitoring
- On-demand model retraining through admin interface
